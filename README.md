# Hyprland - dotfiles

Many scripts are from JaKooLits Dotfiles, so huge credit goes to them for their incredible work. My Neovim config is from NVChad.
This is mostly for arch and distros based on it, these configs should work on other distrobrutions although I cannot guarentee it.

### Needed Packages:
- Rofi (Wayland fork)
- Hyprland
- SwayNC
- Waybar
- Kitty
- Cava
- Btop
- NeoVim
- SwayLock
- Thunar file manager
- Fish + Oh My Fish
- NWG Displays
- Python 3
- Python Pip
    - pywal (pip package)
- Eza
 
Automation, Hyprlock, Hyprcursor, Hypridle and more coming soon...

### Post Installation
- **Hold down** `Super + Enter` **and run** `sh $HOME/.config/scripts/afterinstallation.sh` **to make all scripts executable and add yourself to the input group.** This is required for keybind and waybar functionality.
- Look through the help menu by holding down `MOD + H`
- Look through the fish config (if you are planning on staying with fish shell) in `~/.config/fish/config.fish` for aliases you may not be familiar with.
- Modify the apps listed on the waybar, Neovim theme, wallpaper, etc. all to your liking.   
- Modify the `~/.config/hypr/configs/ENVariables.conf` to your graphics cards needs.
- Have fun!

### Configuration
All keybindings are binded from `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

Apps started on startup can be edited from `~/.config/hypr/configs/Startup_Apps.conf`

Other Hyprland configurations are located within `~/.config/hypr/configs/UserSettings.conf`
