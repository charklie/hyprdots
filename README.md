# Hyprland - dotfiles

Many scripts are from JaKooLits Dotfiles, so huge credit goes to them.
My NeoVim config is from AstroNVim, although slightly altered.
This is mostly for arch and distros based on it, and I cannot guarentee these configs to work with other distrobrutions to work.

Needed Packages:
- Rofi (Wayland fork)
- Hyprland
- SwayNC
- Waybar
- Kitty
- Cava
- Btop
- NeoVim
- SwayLock
- Thunar file manager
- Oh My Fish
- NWG Displays
  
Hyprlock, Hyprcursor and Hypridle configs coming soon...
