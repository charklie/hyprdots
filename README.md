# Hyprland - dotfiles

Many scripts are from JaKooLits Dotfiles, so huge credit goes to them for their incredible work. My Neovim config is from NVChad.
This is mostly for arch and distros based on it, these configs should work on other distrobrutions although I cannot guarentee it.

Needed Packages:
- Rofi (Wayland fork)
- Hyprland
- SwayNC
- Waybar
- Kitty
- Cava
- Btop
- NeoVim
- SwayLock
- Thunar file manager
- Oh My Fish
- NWG Displays
  
Hyprlock, Hyprcursor and Hypridle configs coming soon...

Post Installation
- Run ´sh $HOME/.config/scripts/afterinstallation.sh´ to make all scripts executable.
- Look through the help menu by holding down ´MOD + H´
